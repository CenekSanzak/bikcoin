About the fact that we need to buy Bitcoin. 
This repo is a web3 project that uses 2 smart contracts on the Binance Smart Chain Testnet. 
It is served on [Github Pages](https://supiket.github.io/bikcoin). \
In the demo you can verify an address on the blockchain or query if an address is verified using Verification Contract and you can mint, transfer and trace product NFTs using Product Provenance Contract.
